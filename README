Red-Green glasses will show the cube as a 3D wireframe.
The cube's motion is controlled by arrow keys.

COMMENT
Coding was done with TextPad, a graphical text editor with a built in java compiler.
I'll uploat a .bat file for recompiling sources, so that they all get compiled in the right order.
I have not done so yet.
